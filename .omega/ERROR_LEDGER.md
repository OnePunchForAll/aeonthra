### Missing direct handoff between extension and app

- Symptom: the extension could export JSON and open the workspace, but it could not transfer a queued capture bundle in one flow.
- Root cause: no typed bridge protocol existed between the content script and the page, and the background worker had no pending-pack queue.
- Fix: added validated bridge messages, pending bundle storage, content-script relay logic, and a `Done Learning` action that opens the workspace and triggers import.

### Unvalidated persisted bundles

- Symptom: local storage reads in the web app trusted raw JSON without schema validation.
- Root cause: storage helpers cast parsed JSON directly to `CaptureBundle`.
- Fix: switched storage reads to `CaptureBundleSchema.safeParse(...)` so bad payloads degrade to a clean empty state instead of poisoning the workspace.
