### [RENDER] Infinite render loop — Maximum update depth exceeded

**Status**: FIXED
**Root cause**: `useEffect([READING, sectionsRead])` in AeonthraShell.tsx called `onProgressUpdate({chapterCompletion})` unconditionally. Since `progress` is a `useMemo` dependency of `workspace`, any progress update produced a new `workspace` → new `shellData` → new `READING` reference → useEffect re-fires → infinite loop.
**Symptom**: 500+ "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in browser console on every load; app UI hung.
**Fix**: Added `prevChapterKeyRef = useRef(null)` guard. Effect computes `JSON.stringify(chapterCompletion)` and returns early if unchanged from previous call. Identical pattern to existing `prevProgressKeyRef` mastery guard.
**Guard**: `if (prevChapterKeyRef.current === key) return;` at top of useEffect body — breaks the loop regardless of how READING is reconstructed.
**Introduced by**: Chapter completion useEffect added without the stabilization guard that all other progress effects use.

### [DEV] Vite fs.allow blocks shared packages — blank app in dev mode

**Status**: FIXED
**Root cause**: The worktree's `packages/` symlink targets resolve to the MAIN repo path (`Canvas Converter/packages/...`). Vite follows symlinks and checks the real path against `fs.allow`. The allow list only contained the worktree root, so all `@learning/schema` and `@learning/content-engine` module requests got 500 errors. React never initialized and the page stayed blank.
**Symptom**: App blank in dev server after any page reload; console showed "Invalid hook call" from React module-graph corruption caused by 500s on `shell-mapper.ts`; network showed `shell-mapper.ts → 500`.
**Fix**: Added main repo root (`../../../../` from `apps/web/`) to `fs.allow` in `apps/web/vite.config.ts`. Production build was already unaffected (Rollup resolves through symlinks without path restriction).
**Guard**: `vite.config.ts` comment documents why both paths are needed. Any new worktree must replicate this two-path allow list.

### [PIPELINE] Source quality gate planned but never implemented

**Status**: FIXED
**Root cause**: `source-quality.ts` was referenced in ERROR_LEDGER and shell-mapper.ts types but the file did not exist. The import caused a silent undefined at runtime.
**Symptom**: No quality banner ever appeared; `synthesisMode` was always undefined; degraded bundles silently produced full-quality output.
**Fix**: Created `packages/content-engine/src/source-quality.ts` from scratch with `assessSourceQuality()` and `qualityBannerText()`. Exported from `index.ts`. Wired into `shell-mapper.ts::mapSynthesis()`. Banner rendered in AeonthraShell Home view.
**Guard**: `ShellSynthesis` type now has required `qualityBanner`, `qualityWarnings`, and `synthesisMode` fields — TypeScript will error if the gate is removed without updating the type.

### [PIPELINE] Chapter starvation for non-page-heavy courses

**Status**: FIXED
**Root cause**: `workspace.ts` built chapters exclusively from `kind === "page"` items. Courses with only discussions, quizzes, or assignments produced zero chapters → Reader view empty, Library blank.
**Symptom**: Discussion-only course exports showed empty Reader with no content to read.
**Fix**: Broadened chapter source: collect all items with conceptIds; prefer pages if ≥ 2 exist, otherwise use any kind. Deduplication by moduleKey preserved.
**Guard**: Logic documented in `category-and-module-normalization` skill. Future changes to chapter construction must preserve the page-preference fallback.

### [SCORING] Repeated boilerplate items inverting concept ranking

**Status**: FIXED
**Root cause**: Raw frequency scoring in `buildConceptSupport()` counted each canvas source occurrence at weight 1.0. A course with 8 identical "Reflection Activity" items scored reflection concepts higher than concepts backed by 2 textbook chapters.
**Symptom**: Top concepts in Ethics courses were generic reflection scaffolds, not philosophical concepts.
**Fix**: Added `buildCloneFamilies()` and `buildDiversityWeights()` to synthesis.ts. Clone families weighted 1.0 / 0.3 / 0.05 (first / second / third+ member). Textbook items always weight 1.0 (bypass discounting). Score formula updated to use weighted counts for canvas, textbook, and assignment buckets.
**Guard**: `distinct-evidence-scoring` skill documents required outcome: clone families beyond first member contribute < 1/20 of naive weight.

### Missing direct handoff between extension and app

- Symptom: the extension could export JSON and open the workspace, but it could not transfer a queued capture bundle in one flow.
- Root cause: no typed bridge protocol existed between the content script and the page, and the background worker had no pending-pack queue.
- Fix: added validated bridge messages, pending bundle storage, content-script relay logic, and a `Done Learning` action that opens the workspace and triggers import.

### Unvalidated persisted bundles

- Symptom: local storage reads in the web app trusted raw JSON without schema validation.
- Root cause: storage helpers cast parsed JSON directly to `CaptureBundle`.
- Fix: switched storage reads to `CaptureBundleSchema.safeParse(...)` so bad payloads degrade to a clean empty state instead of poisoning the workspace.
